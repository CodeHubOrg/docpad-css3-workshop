#Introduction to DocPad and CSS Challenge

[![DocPad Logo](docpad_sets_you_free.gif)](http://docpad.org "Visit the DocPad Website")

##How to use this material

Starting from an empty folder, the lessons will incrementally create a full DocPad site with some terrible, terrible CSS animations.

Each lesson has a readme.md describing the steps and sample code representing the goal end point. Do your best to build the system yourself by following the steps but if you get stuck or behind then feel free to dip in and borrow bits from the sample.

##Clone the lesson repo

git clone https://github.com/CodeHubOrg/docpad-css3-workshop.git
or

download the zip

Have fun!
